Project 1 

For our project we've discovered a dataset that explores the impact of one's lifestyle on overall wellbeing. This dataset encompasses a comprehensive collection of 15,977 survey responses, each featuring 24 distinct attributes that offer insights into various aspects of our daily lives. Following the completion of the survey, participants were assigned a work-life balance score. Leveraging this score, we embarked on a quest to uncover correlations between each attribute and the obtained score.
I took and interest in analyzing the relationship between 
•	Healthy Diets 
o	Daily intake of fruits and vegetables
•	Daily Exercises 
o	Steps taken throughout the day
•	Sleep Hours
o	Hours of time each day spent sleeping
When examining the relationship between healthy diets and Work Life Balance Scores, it becomes evident that increased fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with higher Work Life Balance Scores, leading to a healthier lifestyle. An age comparison revealed that, in general, both males and females tend to have a low average intake of fruits and vegetables until they reach their 30s to 50s when their intake peaks. However, after the age of 50, it declines to levels similar to those in their 20s. A noteworthy finding is that during their 20s, only one in five males meet the recommended daily intake of fruits and vegetables.

To analyze Work Life Balance Scores, we categorized them into poor, good, and excellent. It became apparent that Work Life Balance Scores exhibit a significant increase when individuals increase their fruit and vegetable intake from 0 to 2 servings, transitioning from a poor to a good score. Going from a good to an excellent score only requires an additional 1 serving, making the ideal intake around 2 to 2.5 servings.

In our exploration of Daily Steps vs. Work Life Balance Score, we found that, on average, both males and females take a similar number of steps, but females tend to achieve higher Work Life Balance Scores. Comparing age groups, individuals in their 30s tend to take more steps, possibly due to having more free time for exercise. This age range also exhibits the most significant gap in steps between males and females. When examining Work Life Balance Score categories, the increase is linear, and males tend to take more steps on average.

In the comparison of Sleeping Hours vs. Work Life Balance Score, we discovered that 8 hours of sleep is the recommended optimal duration, leading to the highest Work Life Balance Scores. Any sleep duration exceeding 8 hours leads to a decrease in Work Life Balance Scores. In the age comparison, people in their 30s tend to sleep the least, and overall, females sleep less than males. Sleep duration begins to increase after people reach their 40s. When Work Life Balance Scores are categorized into bins, the increase in scores doesn't show substantial improvements after reaching 6 to 7 hours of sleep per day.

In conclusion, maintaining a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, engaging in daily exercise, and adhering to a healthy sleep schedule are key factors contributing to an improved Work Life Balance Score, ultimately leading to a healthier and happier life.
