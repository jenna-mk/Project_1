# Project 1: An Analysis of Work-Life Balance Scores Across 5 Dimensions of Lifestyle/Health

## Networking/Connection

Trends were analyzed relating the Work-Life Balance Scores with questions involving networking and connection. Specifically, the answers to the following questions were analyzed:

1.	With how many people do you interact with during a typical day?
2.	How man people are very close to you?
3.	How many new places do you visit?

The data on the results to each of these questions indicate that they each have a direct correlation with the calculated Work-Life Balance Score. In other words, the higher respondents answered each question, the higher, generally, their calculated Work-Life Balance Scores were. Questions 2 and 3 showed very close to a linear relationship between their responses and Work-Life Balance Score. The first question, regarding how many people the respondent interacts with on a typical day, showed a more interesting relationship where the Work-Life Balance Score tended to level off as the responses got higher.

When analyzed with a question involving typical daily stress, this data appears to show that there may be diminishing returns on happiness/work-life balance as someone interacts with more and more people. This may indicate that respondents experience a certain level of fatigue when it comes to daily interactions with other people.

## Healthy Mind 
Trends were analyzed relating the Work-Life Balance Scores with questions involving healthy mind practices. Specificlaly, the answers to the following questions were analyzed:

1. How much stress do you typically experience everyday?
2. How often do you shout or sulk at somebody?
3. In a typical day, how many hours do you experience "flow"?
4. How many hours do you spend everyday doing what you are passionate about
5. In a typical week, how many times do you have the opportunity to think about yourself?

The results of this analysis show that the above questions are directly related to work-life balance scores positively for the "good" mental activities (which includes flow, time spent on activities you are passionate about, and thinking about yourself/meditative activities) and negatively with the "bad" mental activities (which includes stress and shouting/sulking). The plots for this section can be found in the healthy_mind_analysis.ipynb file, and the summary table can be found in the data folder under healthy_mind_summary.csv.
